## Introduction

This project showcases a data cleaning and organizing pipeline developed with Python's Pandas library. It focuses on resolving common data issues like missing values, inconsistent formatting, and unstructured data using regular expressions, alongside performing basic statistical analysis to summarize the data.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning:** Identify and fix missing, erroneous, or inconsistent data to ensure dataset quality.
- **Data Organization:** Restructure the dataset for better usability and further analysis.
- **Basic Statistical Analysis:** Perform descriptive statistics such as mean, median and mode to understand the dataset’s characteristics.
- **Regular Expression (Regex) Support:** Extract, clean, or standardize unstructured data elements using regex patterns.
